notes:
if you decide to check the editors/ generators, check the MAP_GENERATOR only AFTER you have graded my work, since it
automatically edits resource files when you close it, and may ruin some maps if you are not familiar with it

new branch created to replace the main one since it was full of garbage commit messages
also the README.txt was changed
