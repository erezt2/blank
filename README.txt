uses the modules:
pygame, shapely, mutagen, pydub, simpleaudio

* ONLY KEYBOARD IS FULLY SUPPORTED, IT IS POSSIBLE AND RECOMMENDED PLAYING WITHOUT TOUCHING THE MOUSE
* (meaning that there are some functions that are NOT supported by the mouse)

default controls:
w - up, a - left, s - down, d -right
e - interact, q - secondary action
tab - switch modes (used in menu or in shop)
e - battle confirm
q - battle switch menu

for the full tutorial, go into the tutorial category inside the game
(start menu -> start button -> view tutorial)
or inside the game
(esc -> misc -> tutorial)

to start run init.py

notes:
if you decide to check the editors/ generators, check the MAP_GENERATOR only AFTER you have graded my work, since it
automatically edits resource files when you close it, and may ruin some maps if you are not familiar with it

I've decided to submit this game for 11th grade project instead of 12th, so i didn't have much
time to add much content, so there is only one continent (+incomplete first map of the second) instead of about ten.
the planned world map is at ./resources/other - so thats sad, also, the code for boss fights was used only once.

* the boss fights are similar to the mechanics used in undertale battles (google undertale gameplay) in the way
that attacks are thrown at you and you need to dodge (but unlike undertale, there are no turns, and you attack with
the battle keys while you are attacked)

if you want to see the code you really shouldn't because i've written like 50% percent of this
in 9th grade and I was too lazy to fix all the shitty things in the code so its ugly
(mostly the battle code, but i did fix some of it)
